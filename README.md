# Data Structures and Algorithms with Python Kent D. Lee
 Code created by me from the Data Structures and Algorithms book written by Kent D. Lee. Feel free to download it and have fun, or contribute to it. I could use some help. :)
 
 I just started this repository because I was getting tired of having to do the Sudoku solver alone. Hopefully, if you have the book, please feel free to contribute to all of my code and point out any flaws.

 Note: I know zilch about computational complexity because I skipped the entire chapter. If anyone can summarize it in a few words, I'll be forever grateful to you. :D
